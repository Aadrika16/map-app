Map Dashboard Application
This is a full-stack React application that includes a map view, a dashboard, and JWT-based authentication. The frontend is built with React, and the backend is built with Node.js and Express. The map is integrated using the Leaflet library, and Material UI is used for styling the UI components.

Features
JWT Authentication: Login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.

Dashboard: Displays cards with information, each of which links to the map view.

Map View: Displays a map of India, integrated with Leaflet, and allows users to zoom in and zoom out.

API Endpoints:

/api/login: Allows users to log in and obtain a JWT token.

/api/dashboard: Provides protected data for the dashboard.

/api/map: Provides the configuration for the map view.
